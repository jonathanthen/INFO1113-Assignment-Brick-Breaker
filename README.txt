My breaker app consists of the main App, Game class, Brick class, Powerup class and Objs superclass.
The Paddle and Ball classes are inherited from the Objs superclass.

Reading in Levels:
In App.java (Line 46), replace the string with the first file name. (Do not include .json at the end).

Instructions:
The Paddle and Ball starts in the centre of the screen and the game starts when the user presses the SPACE button.
Player 1's Paddle is controlled by 'A' and 'D' keys while Player 2's Paddle is controlled by 'J' and 'L' keys.
If the Ball hits the Paddle in the centre, the Ball will move faster.
If the Ball hits the sides of the Paddle while the Paddle is moving, it will rebound as well move towards the direction the Paddle is.
Press 'R' to reset the game.

Player(s) win if they destroy all bricks and complete all levels.
Player(s) lose if the Ball falls out of bottom frame.
